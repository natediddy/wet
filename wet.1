.SH ENVIRONMENT
There are 2 environment variables that can simplify use.
.RS
.TP
\fBWET_LOCATION\fP
set this to your desired \fILOCATION\fP and you will no
longer have to provide that \fILOCATION\fP every time you
execute this program (unless overridden on the command line)
.TP
\fBWET_UNITS\fP
set this to either \fBimperial\fP or \fBmetric\fP and the
program will always use those units (unless overridden on the command line)
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
\fB0\fP
success
.TP
\fB1\fP
a problem concerning command line options occurred
.TP
\fB2\fP
a problem concerning \fILOCATION\fP occurred (e.g. it was neither given on the
command line nor \fBWET_LOCATION\fP, or too many were given)
.TP
\fB3\fP
a problem concerning the network occurred
.TP
\fB4\fP
a problem concerning the system occurred
.TP
\fB5\fP
a problem concerning the weather data occurred (e.g. \fILOCATION\fP was
invalid and could not be determined)
.SH EXAMPLE
For the sake of clarity, all of the below examples assume you want
\fILOCATION\fP to be New York, NY USA (zip code: 10001).
.PP
To be presented with a basic set of weather data, just run with no options:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet 10001

.fam T
.fi
The \fILOCATION\fP argument may be a standard zip code or a string
representation:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet "new york city"

.fam T
.fi
If you do not wish to provide a \fILOCATION\fP every time, set the
\fBWET_LOCATION\fP environment variable:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     WET_LOCATION=10001

.fam T
.fi
Also set your desired set of units with the \fBWET_UNITS\fP environment
variable:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     WET_UNITS=imperial

.fam T
.fi
Now all future executions of wet (in the current shell) without a
\fILOCATION\fP will use $\fBWET_LOCATION\fP, and the same with
$\fBWET_UNITS\fP.
.PP
For a more permanent solution, you may want to add something like the
following to your \fI~/.bashrc\fP configuration file:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     export WET_LOCATION=10001
     export WET_UNITS=imperial

.fam T
.fi
Then this:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    wet imperial 10001

.fam T
.fi
Will simply become this:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    wet

.fam T
.fi
All of the following examples will assume that \fBWET_LOCATION\fP and
\fBWET_UNITS\fP are both set as mentioned above.
.PP
To obtain more specific data you can use the commands and their options.
.PP
Current temperature:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet cc temp

.fam T
.fi
Current humidity:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet cc humidity

.fam T
.fi
Current wind conditions:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet cc wind

.fam T
.fi
For today's forecasted high and low temperatures:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet fc high low

.fam T
.fi
For tomorrow's forecasted humidity:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet fc tomorrow humidity

.fam T
.fi
And for the day-after-tomorrow's complete forecast:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet fc 3

.fam T
.fi
For the complete 5 day forecast
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      wet fc all
.fam T
.fi
